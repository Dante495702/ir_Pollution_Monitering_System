# Air_Pollution_Monitering_System
The system consists of air sensors that sense the presence of harmful gases and compounds in the air Arduino code and components used
IoT-based air quality monitoring system using Arduino, you can use air sensors that can detect harmful gases and compounds in the air.
One popular type of air sensor is the MQ series gas sensor, which can detect various gases like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), alcohol (C2H5OH), and others. 
Components Required:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno or Arduino Mega)
MQ-135 gas sensor
Breadboard and jumper wires
Power supply (battery or USB cable)
